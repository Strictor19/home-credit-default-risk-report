# Home Credit Default Risk – ML & DL Comparative Study

This repository presents a complete end-to-end solution for credit default risk prediction using the [Home Credit Default Risk dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-credit-default-risk). 
The project systematically evaluates both classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models—Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, DNN, CNN, and LSTM—under consistent preprocessing,
feature selection, and cross-validation protocols.

## Key Steps Included

- Rigorous data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Handling of class imbalance with algorithmic and sampling strategies  
- Training and evaluation of 8 different ML/DL models  
- Model comparison using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC metrics  
- Visualization of confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importances  

Both the executable Colab notebook (in Turkish) and the final IEEE-format project paper (in English) are included in this repository.
